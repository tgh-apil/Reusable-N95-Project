## [APIL](https://apil.ca)-[CIGITI](https://www.cigiti.ca)-[GLIA](https://glia.org)-[Lakehead](https://northernontarioppe.ca)-McMaster-NOSM-[Queen's](http://ppekingston.squarespace.com/)-USASK-[UofT](https://www.3dppegtha.ca) collab
### Urgent design, testing, recommendation, upscale, dissemination of stop-gap N95 mask options with guidelines in light of disrupted N95 supply to COVID-19 era Canada
- This collaborative is an open-source, data-sharing, parallel development of the common goal (see CERN 2.0 License)
- Investigate back-up stop-gap plan for N95 depletion in Ontario, Canada, [see Article on Medium.com](https://medium.com/@williamckng/stop-gap-n95-mask-in-the-time-of-covid-19-a615be38eb31)
- Reuse of disposable N95 is preferred at this stage by decontamination (VPHP, UVGI, Heat).

## [Project Timeline](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/00-Timeline/Timeline%20Projection%20N95.md)

*Current focus*:
- form-fit test Simple Silicone Respirator with Intersurgical AirGuard ~HME~ bacterial/viral filters focus on refining
- ~form-fit test APIL NIH Unibody Silicone Respirator with HME bacterial/viral filters~ pause on this design

*Weekly focus*:
- HC MDEL (Nasa, Arash, Vahid, Will, Dorotea from GLIA)
- Modified NIOSH at Gage (25 May 2020)
- SSM Dual Port prototype with insp. and exp. silicone valves, +/- TAVISH valves from Sameeer
- Volunteer testing: *SSM + AirGuard pass rate >99%, 3M N95 <75%, n=36.* 
- Aim 5 iterations max for every 104 volunteers. (Will et al.)
- TME Inc. with 2nd stop-gap for testing, TBC
- modified NIOSH 19 or 20 May 2020
- Funding (OCE awaiting vetting response, MITACS, NRC)

*Filter Challenge*
- 2nd Leap (pre-clinical trial phase *now*): SSM Duo with dual OTS pleated HEPA filters, one-way valves to preserve filters, improve breathing and audio quality 
- Then followed by alternative filter material, tightly-sealed cartridge system to increased surface area for airflow. (Lakehead-NOSM Team Andre, Chris, Mike, Siamak; UofT R&D Team Arash, Chandra, Jessica, Nasa, Natasha, Yu; also thanks Jake Bender from GLIA for [bayonet designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4302122))
- Bayonet adapter prototype test 3M 2000 and 6000X series
- 3rd Leap: Complete filter replacement solution.

*Medium term challenge*:
- Send samples to partners (lakehead, queen's, others who enquire)
- Funding
- Multi-site testing for reproducibility and validation.
- Reduce silicone load of SSM by 25%
- Industry partner(s) to produce own mask body and/or disseminate SSM and upscale option(s).
- Medical Grade filter sourcing, preferred non-HME as they produce condensation on wearer-side (DAR, Intersurgical)
- Comparative estimation of *Benefit*, *Cost* and *Time* to producing first 1000 units.
- Set-up rolling working group Jun 2020 ff
- *Pandemic Resurgence Jun 2020 - Aug 2020 ff*

## [Design Options](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/02-Design%20Types)
### SSM (UHN APIL and CIGITI)
- Derived from SSR, new geometry, new mould, new process.
- Modular adapters that can fit anything to silicone seal.
- SSM S - 90% downsize (73% by volume); will need 95% (86% by volume)
- New prototype "Dual Port" with 3 modular adapters for 2 filters and 1 exp. valve or 1 filter and 2 exp. valves, or other combo
### Toronto MicroElectronics
- Plastic with dual-collar silicone rim
### NIH released open sources
- https://3dprint.nih.gov/collections/covid-19-response
- many variations to choose from, apart form the above, which have gained traction and use in several hospitals
- UHN APIL modification to Unibody Silicone with *adapter for 15mm to 22mm adapter* (TBC).
### Simple Silicone Respirator (MB-ON collab)
- created by Christian Petropolis (Plastics Surgery) at HSC Manitoba; [UHN APIL refining, validating, developing](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/02-Design%20Types/SSR%20MB-ON) 
- silicone material dragon skin sx pro to 10, durometer 2A - 10A
- attaches to commerical filters 15mm to 22mm; M size fits small to large; planning for S and L sizes.

## Prototype, Refinement [(Natasha, Jess, Andy, et al.)](#APILUHN)
- SSM ~Manitoba SSR~ M (S done) - 8 May 2020
- *SSM Dual Port M - prototype required 20 May 2020*
- Seal and fit problem - seal adequate 24 April 2020, comfort and breathabilith (nasal pad adjustment)
- Onepiece Silicone Iteration - required 24 April 2020 - done
- Filtration area needs to be maximally increased for WOB and any remote chance of getting NIOSH testing
- Considering 2 filter cartridge system with tight seal (Lakehead|Andre, APIL|UofT R&D, NOSM|Michael, Jay Pooley)
- Montana S, M, L size (modified) - (CIGITI|Brandon)
- Kingston XS, S, M, L, XL, Snowcone S, M - Fit-test Kingston Masks from Queen's - 23 April 2020
- ~NIH S, M. (XS needs redesigning)~ - pause on this 15 April 2020
- ~I3D XS, S, M prototypes built~ - archived
- ~Adapter to ROXON filter functional as stop-gap option~ (no longer pursued given poor NIOSH testing)
- ~single filter cartridge system with N95 medium~ (no longer pursued given poor breathability with good mask seal)

## [Local Testing](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/04-Testing) [(Will et al.)](#UofT)
### Particulate and NIOSH test
- 104 feasible for 4-5 iterations of publishable volunteer data
- James Scott and Jeff Brook from UofT OS & EH 13 April 2020 - proof of concept testing
- excluded single FLAT N95 filter option, either double cartridge system, or pleated bacterial/viral filter required.
- Consider pursuing N90 grade with Merv 15 filter (suggested by Queen's https://www.mcmaster.com/22905k28)

### [OSHA and Bitrex Testing](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/04-Testing/Test%20Protocol%20-%20Bitrex.md)
- Portacount or AccuFIT fit-testing as per OSHA/CSA protocol, standard 7 Fit-Factor Rubric: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA
- Pooling Non-UHN partners SickKids, Queen's University (KHSC), other OHS to perform CSA standard mask-fit test
- Functional Test as for any in-person testing using "spray under the hood" Bitrex
- UHN OHS involved, Craig Parsons and Sharon Martin (Mgr Frank Turner). UHN IPAC represented by Dr Alon Vaisman.
