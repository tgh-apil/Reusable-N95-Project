# Reusable N95 Respirator
An open-source, reusable N95 respirator that can be manufactured at scale in small community or hospital-based facilities, using 3D printing, silicone casting and standard HME filters.

# DISCLAIMER

This is an **INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICAL DEVICE** being evaluated for use
in hospital setting during **extreme crisis** leading to N95
shortages.

It has **not been approved** by any regulatory body.

Its use is **not endorsed** by any institution or professional body,
including the ones where it was developed and tested.

We have made every effort to make the system as safe as possible and to
provide documentation and educational materials for its use, should it be
necessary, in order to minimize the very significant risks of iatrogenic harm.

Any clinical application requires close monitoring of patients by automated 
systems and living, breathing care providers familiar with the system and its 
hazards.

It is posted here in order to facilitate rapid knowledge sharing and research
on strategies for addressing the global ventilator shortages.
