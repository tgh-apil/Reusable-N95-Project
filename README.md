## [APIL](https://apil.ca)-[CIGITI](https://www.cigiti.ca)-[GLIA](https://glia.org)-[Lakehead](https://northernontarioppe.ca)-McMaster-NOSM-[Queen's](http://ppekingston.squarespace.com/)-USASK-[UofT](https://www.3dppegtha.ca) collab
### Urgent design, testing, recommendation, upscale, dissemination of stop-gap N95 mask options with guidelines in light of disrupted N95 supply to COVID-19 era Canada
- This collaborative is an open-source, data-sharing, parallel development of the common goal (see CERN 2.0 License)
- Investigate back-up stop-gap plan for N95 depletion in Ontario, Canada, [see Article on Medium.com](https://medium.com/@williamckng/stop-gap-n95-mask-in-the-time-of-covid-19-a615be38eb31)
- Reuse of disposable N95 is preferred at this stage by decontamination (VPHP, UVGI, Heat).

## [Project Timeline](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/00-Timeline/Timeline%20Projection%20N95.md)

*Current focus*:
- form-fit test Simple Silicone Respirator with Intersurgical AirGuard ~HME~ bacterial/viral filters focus on refining
- ~form-fit test APIL NIH Unibody Silicone Respirator with HME bacterial/viral filters~ pause on this design

*Weekly focus*:
- Volunteer testing: *SSM + AirGuard pass rate >95%, 3M ~75%, n=26.* 
- Aim 3 iterations max for every 52 volunteers. (Andrew et al.)
- TME Inc. with 2nd stop-gap for testing, TBC
- modified NIOSH 19 or 20 May 2020
- Reduce silicone load of SSM by 25%
- 

*Filter Challenge*
- 2nd Leap: Dual flat filter in tightly-sealed cartridge system to increased surface area for airflow. We better start *now*. (Lakehead-NOSM Team Andre, Chris, Mike, Siamak; UofT R&D Team Arash, Chandra, Jessica, Nasa, Natasha, Yu; also thanks Jake Bender from GLIA for [bayonet designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4302122))
- 3rd Leap: Complete filter replacement solution.

*Medium term challenge*:
- Multi-site testing for reproducibility and validation.
- 
- Industry partner(s) to produce own mask body and/or disseminate SSM and upscale option(s).
- Medical Grade filter sourcing, preferred non-HME as they produce condensation on wearer-side (DAR, Intersurgical)
- Estimation of unit *Cost* and *Time* to producing first 1000 units.

## [Design Options](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/02-Design%20Types)

- working in parallel with USASK on sealing with silicone rims to flexible PLA/TPU mask bodies
- fit-testing done by OSH at KGH
### [USASK Mask](https://medicine.usask.ca/news/2020/usask-engineering-team-designing-3d-printed-n95-masks-to-help-combat-covid-19.php)

## Prototype, Refinement [(Josh et al.)](#APILUHN)
- Montana S, M, L size (modified) - (CIGITI|Brandon)
- Kingston XS, S, M, L, XL, Snowcone S, M - Fit-test Kingston Masks from Queen's - 23 April 2020
- Manitoba SSR M (S to come) - required 30 April 2020
- Seal and fit problem - seal adequate 24 April 2020, comfort level
- Onepiece Silicone Iteration - required 24 April 2020 - done
- Filtration area needs to be maximally increased for WOB and any remote chance of getting NIOSH testing
- Considering 2 filter cartridge system with tight seal (Lakehead|Andre, APIL|UofT R&D, NOSM|Michael, Jay Pooley)
- ~NIH S, M. (XS needs redesigning)~ - pause on this 15 April 2020
- ~I3D XS, S, M prototypes built~ - archived
- ~Adapter to ROXON filter functional as stop-gap option~ (no longer pursued given poor NIOSH testing)
- ~single filter cartridge system with N95 medium~ (no longer pursued given poor breathability with good mask seal)

## [Local Testing](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/tree/master/04-Testing) [(Andrew)](#UofT)
### Particulate and NIOSH test
- James Scott and Jeff Brook from UofT OS & EH 13 April 2020 - proof of concept testing
- excluded single FLAT N95 filter option, either double cartridge system, or pleated bacterial/viral filter required.
- Consider pursuing N90 grade with Merv 15 filter (suggested by Queen's https://www.mcmaster.com/22905k28)

### [OSHA and Bitrex Testing](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Project/blob/master/04-Testing/Test%20Protocol%20-%20Bitrex.md)
- Portacount or AccuFIT fit-testing as per OSHA/CSA protocol, standard 7 Fit-Factor Rubric: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA
- Pooling Non-UHN partners SickKids, Queen's University (KHSC), other OHS to perform CSA standard mask-fit test
- Functional Test as for any in-person testing using "spray under the hood" Bitrex
- UHN OHS involved, Craig Parsons and Sharon Martin (Mgr Frank Turner). UHN IPAC represented by Dr Alon Vaisman.
