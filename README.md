# Disclaimer

The Simple Silicone Mask (SSM) and SSM Duo reusable N95 respirators are experimental medical devices that have been subject validated in 40 and 42 volunteers at a single institution and are intended for pandemic disaster use after firstline disposable N95 respirators. They are not endorsed by any institution, including their originating health institution, nor have they been approved by any regulatory body. Testing in line with NIOSH and ISO guidelines is currently ongoing.

# Documentation
This reusable, locally-manufactured, and open-hardware-licensed N95 respirator was developed in response to the widespread shortages of N95 respirators and other personal protective equipment (PPE) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The source files can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Respirator/tree/master/source%20files) or [maybe here. unclear. note: ask about this](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Respirator/tree/master/02-Design%20Types/Simple%20Silicone%20Mask%20%22SSM%22), along with reference designs [here](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Respirator/tree/master/11-References).

### Funding
No funding was received for this project. (got this from the March 2021 PLOS publication, unsure if that's still true)

### Production
Production information, including a parts list, can be found [here](https://github.com/tgh-apil/Reusable-N95-Respirator/tree/master/03-Production) in the repository.

# Development Team & Collaborators
The SSM design was initially based on the [Simple Silicone Respirator (SSR)](https://github.com/cpetropolis/Simple-Silicone-Respirator) designed by Dr. Christian Petropolis at the University of Manitoba.
