Title: Simple Silicone Mask *aka* "SSM"
Last: 2020 May 3

# Simple Silicone Mask, attribution "SSM"
## Name - "SSM"
- For simplicity we'll name this mask body design and derivatives SSM Simple Silicone Mask
- It is a branch off the Simple Silicone Respirator, which we have called "SSR"
- By itself the "SSM" body is just a mask
- A fitting filter then makes it a Respirator
- We see the future of this stop-gap solution as modular: one mask body can accommodate additional modules

# Ideas for Derviatives
## Dual Filter Cartridge
- If DAR and Intersurgical medical filters are depleted
- Having Modular FIlter solutions means we can adapt to multiple filters that can be sourced.

## Expiratory Valve
- Greatly reduces condensation, heat trap and thus improves wearer comfort
- All valves be potentially be designed with a filter so that the atmospheric air mixture droplets/particles 
is separate from inner air mixture droplets/particles.
- Awaiting Dr. Sameer Masood's design of expiratory valve with filter that can be fitted to non-rebreather masks.

## Integrated Harness
- The harness may be integrated into the body

SSM License is under the Project CERN 2.0 License so that all remain "open".
