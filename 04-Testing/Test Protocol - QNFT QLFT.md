## Ambient Aerosol Count Ratio "Fit-Factor"
- "A Fit Factor is a number that is the direct result of a quantitative respirator fit test. It is a measurement made by an instrument during a simulation of workplace activities (the exercises). It is expressed as the challenge aerosol concentration outside the respirator divided by the challenge aerosol concentration that leaks inside the respirator DURING A FIT TEST"

## NIOSH US BiVariate Facial type

- Andrew: "the total number needed is 18.  See the table in the attached document.  This is the minimum number so long as you meet the number required according to the population distribution."
- technically 2 donnings per mask type.

## APF
- APF 10 for N95
- "An Assigned Protection Factor is the level of protection that a particular type of respirator can be expected to provide 95% of the time. An APF of 10 means that type of respirator (if used properly) can be safely used in an atmosphere that has a hazardous concentration of up to 10 times the Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for that hazard. APF's are determined by the government or a standards organization. In the United States, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) both establish APF's for various types of respirators. For example, a half face negative pressure air purifying respirator typically has an APF of 10. Most full face negative pressure air purifying respirators typically have an APF of 50." quote from [TSI PDF](https://www.tsi.com/getmedia/f07681c1-a465-40d0-9add-85cc5813f0ad/Fit-Factors-vs-Protection-Factors-App-Note-(ITI-023)-US?ext=.pdf)
