## Ambient Aerosol Count Ratio "Fit-Factor"
- "A Fit Factor is a number that is the direct result of a quantitative respirator fit test. It is a measurement made by an instrument during a simulation of workplace activities (the exercises). It is expressed as the challenge aerosol concentration outside the respirator divided by the challenge aerosol concentration that leaks inside the respirator DURING A FIT TEST"
